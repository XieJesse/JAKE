## Mission Statement   
Many romantic relationships break down because of a few reasons: poor communication, a loss in emotional intimacy, or simply because things change between people. With our project, we offer a way to remedy these issues through versatile compliments, which can even be used in non-romantic settings for friends or family.   
## Project Description
Our project for HackBU is a web application where users are presented nouns and phrases that they can select to form sentences. Bx mixing and matching them, the compliments can be heartfelt and genuine, or light-hearted and comedic in nature. When the user is satisfied with the compliment that they have created, they can copy and paste it to share with others, or publish it to a wall for others to see. Posts on the board can be upvoted or downvoted by logged in users, and profiles will display some of the compliments that they have created.
